Here is the highly requested tutorial for my Windows setup on SteamDeck
(https://www.facebook.com/groups/1857754067746453/posts/2092432410945283)
this Tutorial is for Windows 11, but should also work for Win10

**1. Disable login**

**3. Install VLC and Playnite**

**4. Download Scripts**  
download this repo and copy it to your documents folder, so all data is located in e.g C:\Users\Micro\Documents\PlayniteShell  
**5. Edit Desktop.bat:**  
 In the penultimate line: replace C:\Users\Micro\Documents\PlayniteShell\PlayniteShell.exe with your path  
**6. Replace Shell**  
Use BatToExeConverterX64 to convert the PlayniteShell.bat to an exe. Check the flag for the invisible program, then simply convert it into an exe. It should be all very simple and self-explainatory.  
Note: Windows defender will block this exe because of an detected Script/Phonzy.A!ml. This is because the exe will start other apps, just allow it.  

You can use any video as "boot" animation wich is a mp4.
Some good Steamdeck bootvideos can be found here:
